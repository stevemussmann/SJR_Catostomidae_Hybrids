# NewHybrids - simulated data

The subfolders named by species pairs (i.e., `Cdis_x_Clat_3gen`, `Cdis_x_Xtex_3gen`, `Clat_x_Xtex_3gen`) contain files for running NewHybrids on simulated data to assess power of 200 loci to identify individuals belonging to up to three generations of hybrid categories.

The newhybrids_simulation_pipeline was used to select loci for identifying hybrids.
